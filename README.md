# Mathematical-methods-Assignment-3
Application of PDEs - Heat equation solutions
This is an assignment I've been working on as part of the AE601 Mathematical Methods in Aerospace Engineering course. 
This particular assignment caught my interest, featuring 10 problems that delve into the application of partial differential equations in the field of heat transfer.
Completing this assignment has deepened my appreciation for the mathematical models that underlie the functionality of everyday products.
